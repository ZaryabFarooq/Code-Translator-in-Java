# Code-Translator-in-Java

This program was done in several parts to ease the process of debugging. 
Part5 has all the final running parts of the program.

Our professor created a simple language called E language in our Programming Languages course.
The purpose of this program is to translate E programs to their semantically equivalent C programs.
He also provided us the with the grammar of the language E.

I tokenized the complete code in part1 which was really simple.

Checking the syntac proved okay as well.

The hardest part was to do a semantic check which is in part4.

At the end I improvised and added my grammar of a "for loop" in E language. It was easy to implement.

Required knowledge of parsing, compilation and context free grammar symbols.
